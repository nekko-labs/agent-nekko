 * width measured at all, and the ResizeObserver corrects it after layout. That
 * keeps opening a chat to one render: measuring synchronously on mount forced
 * a layout and a second full render of the pane before its first frame. With

 * pane is never laid out at the wrong width. Returns 0 until a width is known,
