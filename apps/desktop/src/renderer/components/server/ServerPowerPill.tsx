/**
 * A server's power button and its state, as one control.
 *
 * These used to be two things side by side: a bare power glyph that did the
 * switching and a badge next to it that said what had happened. People read
 * the badge, clicked the badge, and nothing happened; the glyph that actually
 * worked looked like decoration. So the label *is* the button now: the pill
 * says "Serving" or "Stopped", and clicking it flips that.
 *
 * Shared by the model server and the agent server so the two power controls on
 * the Nekko Server page look and behave identically.
 *
 * Running is filled with the success tone (the same green the old "Serving"
 * badge used); stopped is a neutral outline, so an off server reads as quiet
 * rather than broken. `unavailable` names why it cannot be switched at all
 * ("Not installed"), and disables it.
