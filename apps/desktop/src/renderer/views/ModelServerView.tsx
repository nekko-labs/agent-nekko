/**
 * This machine as a model server.
 *
 * Two halves of one answer, which used to sit at opposite ends of the Models
 * page under two other things. The first is what runs the models: the engine, the
 * models it can load, where those models come from on disk, and the address it
 * serves them on. The second is what runs *this app*: the local API, the command
 * line, and the MCP entry other agents use it through.
 *
 * They belong together because they are the same question asked twice — what on
 * this computer can other software talk to — and because the page that answers
 * it is not the page where you connect an Anthropic key. That one is Model
 * Providers now.
 *
 * Opening a model from the catalog takes the whole view rather than unfolding a
 * drawer: a model card, a download-count, a ladder of builds and a license is a
 * page's worth of reading, and it should not have to happen inside a list.
