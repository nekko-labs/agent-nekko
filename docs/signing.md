# Release signing

How Agent Nekko's macOS builds get signed and notarized, what is wired, and what
needs a human with an Apple account.

Everything here is **secret-gated**. With no signing secrets configured the
release still builds and publishes, just unsigned, so nothing below can block a
release. A *partially* configured set fails the job before building, because a
signed-but-unnotarized app is still blocked by Gatekeeper while looking like it
worked.

## Status at a glance

| Platform | Mechanism | Wired | Blocked on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | Developer ID codesign + notarization | ✅ live since v0.6.0 | nothing |
| Windows | Authenticode | ✅ secret-gated | the org secrets being set |
| Linux | none (AppImage/deb are unsigned) | n/a | n/a |

## macOS

Agent Nekko is packaged by electron-builder, which does the signing, hardened
runtime, and notarization itself. There is no hand-rolled `codesign` pipeline
here, and no `Developer ID Installer` certificate is needed, because the
artifacts are `.dmg`/`.zip` rather than a `.pkg`.

What is configured, in `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml`:

- `hardenedRuntime: true` — required for notarization
- `entitlements` / `entitlementsInherit` → `build/entitlements.mac.plist`
- `notarize: false` by default, flipped on with `-c.mac.notarize=true` by the
  release workflow, so a local `npm run dist` does not need the Apple API key

`apps/desktop/scripts/after-pack.cjs` ad-hoc signs the app **only when no real
certificate is present**, so unsigned local builds still launch on Apple
Silicon. It steps aside when `CSC_LINK` is set.

### The entitlements, and why each one is there

The hardened runtime disables things Electron and Agent Nekko need. See the
comments in [`build/entitlements.mac.plist`](../apps/desktop/build/entitlements.mac.plist);
the short version:

| Entitlement | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| `allow-jit`, `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` | V8 |
| `disable-library-validation` | the `@lydell/node-pty` prebuilt `.node`, dlopen'd from outside the asar |
| `allow-dyld-environment-variables` | spawning shells, agents, and MCP servers |
| `files.user-selected.read-write` | the user's project folders |
| `network.client` / `network.server` | model providers and the local phone-relay server |
| `device.camera` | the QR pairing scanner |

`NSCameraUsageDescription` is set via `mac.extendInfo`. Without it macOS kills
the process instead of prompting when the QR scanner opens.

## Secrets

These are **`nekko-labs` organization secrets**, shared with `hypergate` and
`lightwrite`, so the certificate is uploaded and rotated in exactly one place.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOS_SIGNING_CERTS_P12` | base64 of the Developer ID `.p12` (→ `CSC_LINK`) |
| `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` | password for that `.p12` (→ `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`) |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_P8` | App Store Connect API key contents |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | ASC key id |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | ASC issuer id (a UUID) |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERTS_P12` | base64 of the Authenticode `.p12` certificate |
| `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` | password for that `.p12` |

Certificate: `Developer ID Application: Nekko Labs LLC (3HM5598S99)`.

### Uploading them

Run on a Mac that has the Developer ID certificate **and its private key** in
the login keychain (`security find-identity -v -p codesigning` to confirm).
Requires org-admin on `nekko-labs`.

Export the `.p12` from **Keychain Access** (login → My Certificates → expand the
`Developer ID Application: Nekko Labs LLC` row so the private key goes with it →
Export), rather than with `security export -t identities`, which dumps *every*
identity in the keychain into one bundle. Either way you choose an export
password, which becomes `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`.

Then, and read the warning below before pasting:

```bash
gh secret set MACOS_SIGNING_CERTS_P12 --org nekko-labs --visibility all < <(base64 -i /tmp/nekko-signing.p12)
gh secret set APPLE_API_KEY_P8 --org nekko-labs --visibility all < AuthKey_XXXXXXXX.p8
gh secret set APPLE_API_KEY_ID --org nekko-labs --visibility all --body AuthKeyIdHere
```

> **Do not paste those as a block with the two interactive ones.** `gh secret
> set` without `--body` reads its value from **stdin**, so a pasted command on
> the following line is consumed as the secret. That is how `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`
> once ended up holding the literal text `gh secret set MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD
> --org nekko-labs --visibility all`, which surfaced only as `MAC verification
> failed during PKCS12 import (wrong password?)` in a release job.

Set the two interactive secrets one at a time. In zsh the prompt form is
`"VAR?prompt"`, not bash's `-p`:

```bash
read -rs "P?p12 password: " && gh secret set MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD --org nekko-labs --visibility all --body "$P" && unset P
read -rs "P?issuer UUID: " && gh secret set APPLE_API_ISSUER --org nekko-labs --visibility all --body "$P" && unset P
```

Then delete the export: `rm -P /tmp/nekko-signing.p12`.

**Verifying the `.p12` locally is a trap.** Keychain encrypts the payload with
`RC2-40-CBC`, which OpenSSL 3 moved to the legacy provider, so
`openssl pkcs12 -info` fails with `unsupported ... RC2-40-CBC` and reads like a
bad password. Pass `-legacy`. The password check that actually matters is the
MAC: a genuinely wrong password says `Mac verify error: invalid password?`,
while reaching the cipher error at all means the password was accepted.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/nekko-signing.p12 -info -noout -legacy
```

Look for a **Shrouded Keybag** line, which confirms the private key is in the
export. macOS `security import` reads the legacy encryption natively, so no
re-export is needed for CI.

### When the App Store Connect key rotates

The notary key is the one credential here that can die without any secret
changing: an App Store Connect API key gets revoked or rotated in Apple's
portal, and `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` / `APPLE_API_KEY_P8` quietly keep pointing at a
key that no longer exists. That happened on 2026-09-06, when the team's key was
replaced and the old one revoked. Every release from v0.7.1 on then signed
fine and died in notarization, five minutes into the job, with:

```
Failed to notarize via notarytool. ... HTTP status code: 401. Unauthenticated.
```

The release workflow now checks the key *before* building ("Validate the
notary credentials"), using the same read-only call you can run locally
against a candidate `.p8`:

```bash
xcrun notarytool history --key AuthKey_XXXXXXXX.p8 --key-id XXXXXXXX --issuer <issuer UUID>
```

A live key lists past submissions (Agent Nekko's and hypergate's, since they
share the team). A revoked one returns the 401 above. The issuer id is per
team and does not change when the key does.

To rotate, with a key whose App Store Connect role is Developer or above, and
after confirming the file really is a private key
(`openssl pkey -in AuthKey_XXXXXXXX.p8 -noout` exits 0):

```bash
gh secret set APPLE_API_KEY_P8 --org nekko-labs --visibility all < AuthKey_XXXXXXXX.p8
gh secret set APPLE_API_KEY_ID --org nekko-labs --visibility all --body XXXXXXXX
```

Then re-run the Release workflow at the tag that failed:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo nekko-labs/agent-nekko --ref vX.Y.Z
```

The secrets are organization-wide, so one rotation also repairs hypergate and
lightwrite.

## Windows

The release workflow passes `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERTS_P12` and
`WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` to electron-builder as `WIN_CSC_LINK` and
`WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`. electron-builder 26.16.1 still supports the legacy
PKCS#12/signtool path through these Windows-specific environment variables;
Azure Trusted Signing is an alternative, not a requirement for this setup.
With both secrets present, the NSIS installer is Authenticode-signed. If no
certificate is configured, the workflow deliberately builds an unsigned
installer so releases remain available; SmartScreen will show an
unknown-publisher warning. A certificate without its password is a
configuration error and fails the Windows job before packaging.

The certificate should contain the private key and be exported as a base64
PKCS#12 file:

```bash
base64 -w0 /path/to/windows-signing.p12 | \
  gh secret set WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERTS_P12 --org nekko-labs --visibility all
gh secret set WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD --org nekko-labs --visibility all
```

Certificates expire (Developer ID is 5 years). When it rolls, re-export and
re-run the two `MACOS_*` commands; nothing in this repo changes.

## npm publishing

The `publish-cli` job uses npm Trusted Publishing as its primary authentication
path. npm's documented requirements are Node `22.14.0` or newer and npm
`11.5.1` or newer; the workflow uses Node 24 and installs npm 11.5.1
explicitly. It prints both versions before publishing and disables
`setup-node` dependency caching because npm's release guidance says not to use
package-manager caching in release builds.

Trusted Publishing uses the GitHub Actions OIDC token from
`id-token: write`. npm automatically generates provenance attestations for
trusted publishes, so the OIDC path does not need `--provenance`. While
bootstrapping, `NPM_TOKEN` remains an optional fallback; that path explicitly
adds `--provenance`. If neither credential works, the workflow prints a
message directing the maintainer to configure the trusted publisher or add
`NPM_TOKEN`.

### First publish bootstrap

npm's documented setup is under an existing package's settings, and npm does
not currently provide a PyPI-style pending publisher for a package name that
has never been published. Publish `agent-nekko` once manually with account
authentication and 2FA:

```bash
npm login
npm publish --workspace=apps/cli --access public
```

Then open the `agent-nekko` package settings on npmjs.com and add a GitHub Actions
trusted publisher with:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Organization or user | `nekko-labs` |
| Repository | `agent-nekko` |
| Workflow filename | `release.yml` |
| Allowed action | `npm publish` |

The workflow file is `.github/workflows/release.yml`; npm wants only the
filename in this field. After confirming a tagged publish succeeds through
OIDC, harden the package's Publishing access settings by requiring 2FA and
disallowing token-based publishing, then revoke the temporary `NPM_TOKEN`
secret. The release job will continue using OIDC after the token is removed.

## Verifying a release

## Installer and updater targets

The release workflow intentionally publishes only targets with a clear
installation story:

| Platform | Artifact | `electron-updater` support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | NSIS `.exe` | ✅ automatic updates |
| macOS | `.dmg` plus required `.zip` metadata artifact | ✅ automatic updates |
| Linux | AppImage | ✅ automatic updates |
| Linux | `.deb` | ✅ supported by current electron-builder updater docs |

The Windows MSI and ZIP targets are not built: MSI is not an updater target and
the ZIP would duplicate the NSIS installation path without adding an updater
benefit. The current electron-builder documentation lists macOS DMG, Windows
NSIS, and Linux AppImage/DEB as auto-updatable targets. Unsigned builds can
still be installed, but signing warnings are independent of updater support.

The release workflow already runs these on every signed macOS build and fails
if any of them do. To check a downloaded `.dmg` by hand:

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 /Applications/Agent Nekko.app
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 /Applications/Agent Nekko.app
xcrun stapler validate /Applications/Agent Nekko.app
```

`spctl` should say `accepted` with `source=Notarized Developer ID`.

## Building signed locally

Only needed when debugging the signing config itself.

```bash
CSC_NAME="Nekko Labs LLC (3HM5598S99)" npm run dist -w @agent-nekko/desktop
```

`CSC_NAME` takes the certificate's **common name without the type prefix**.
Passing the full `Developer ID Application: ...` string fails with *"Please
remove prefix ... appropriate certificate will be chosen automatically"*.

That signs with the local keychain identity but does **not** notarize, so
`stapler validate` will fail on the result. That is expected; Gatekeeper on the
build machine still accepts it because the machine trusts the developer.
