//! The agent's built-in tools for the engine daemon, ported from the TS host:
//! `executeTool` (`packages/host/src/tools.ts`), the guardrail classifier
//! (`packages/core/src/guardrails`), the pending-changes store
//! (`packages/host/src/changes.ts`) and the ported tools' `BUILTIN_TOOLS`
//! specs.
//!
//! The agent loop moves to Rust next (PF14) and calls [`execute`] with a
//! [`ToolContext`] per call. Until then nothing calls this crate at run
//! time; it is held to the TS behaviour by golden files the TS code writes
//! (`tests/golden`, see `packages/host/src/agent-tools.golden.test.ts`).
//!
//! Parity is the point, so the TS semantics are ported rather than
//! approximated: JavaScript regular expressions ([`jsre`]), Node's `path`
//! module ([`path`]), Node's fs error messages and directory order, UTF-16
//! lengths and `String()` coercion of tool arguments. The few deliberate
//! differences are listed where they live (the shell runner kills whole
//! process trees and can be cancelled; strings are never cut inside a
//! surrogate pair).
