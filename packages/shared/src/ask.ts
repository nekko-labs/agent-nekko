/**
 * The agent asking before it acts.
 *
 * An agent that guesses at an ambiguous request spends ten minutes building the
 * wrong thing, and the user only finds out at the end. One question up front is
 * cheaper than that, so the agent gets a tool for it: it stops, asks, and waits
 * for a real answer instead of picking for you and mentioning it in the wrap-up.
 *
 * Deliberately multiple-choice. A free-text prompt is a second conversation and
 * people skip it; a short list of concrete options is a click, and writing the
 * options forces the agent to have actually thought about the alternatives.
 * Every question still takes a typed answer, because the right option is
 * sometimes not on the list.
