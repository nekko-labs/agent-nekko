/**
 * The local API server: Nekko Agent, reachable by other programs.
 *
 * The desktop app already holds everything worth driving — the providers, the
 * workspaces, the sessions with their history — and until now the only way in
 * was the window. Turning this on puts the same host behind `POST /api/:channel`
 * and a `/api/events` socket on this machine, which is the surface the CLI and
 * the MCP server already speak. So `nekko-agent chat "…"` in a terminal, or
 * Claude Code over MCP, talks to *this* app rather than to a second copy of it
 * running on the same files.
 *
 * On by default as of 0.8, because the CLI and the MCP entries are set up by
 * the installer and both of them are useless pointed at a port nothing is
 * listening on. Every *other* default is still the safe one: loopback only, a
 * token required, and a token generated rather than left empty.
