/**
 * Why a model can or can't be run right now.
 *
 * A model list that silently omits what you can't use is indistinguishable from
 * a model list that is broken: "where is Fable?" has the same shape whether the
 * model was never in the catalog, isn't in your plan, or is simply capped until
 * Thursday. So every model a provider knows about stays in the list, and this
 * module carries the reason it can't be picked.
 *
 * Two sources feed it, and neither is vendor-specific:
 *
 * 1. **The catalog** — a provider that ships a static list (Anthropic) declares
 *    what it already knows: a model that needs a bigger plan, one that is API-key
 *    only, one the vendor has retired. Providers whose catalog comes off the wire
 *    (OpenAI, OpenRouter, a local server) simply declare nothing.
 * 2. **Live limits** — the normalized usage windows in `limits.ts`. A model-scoped
 *    window that is exhausted blocks that family; an account-wide window that is
 *    exhausted blocks every model behind that subscription.
 *
 * Pure functions, so the picker, the sidebar, and tests share one answer.
