/**
 * The speed contract's budgets, as p95 in milliseconds. The source of truth is
 * the table under "Speed & responsiveness" in SPEC.md; keep the two in step.
 *
 * `target` is the product budget, met on a desktop at 120 Hz (8.3 ms is one
 * frame there). The GitHub `perf` job runs on a 4-vCPU runner with no GPU and a
 * 60 Hz display, where the same work takes about twice as long, so by default
 * a run is judged against `ci`, two and a half times the target: a regression
 * gate. At exactly twice, a healthy build's p95 sat at 94-104% of the gate
 * because the runner swings about 30% run to run, so the job went red at
 * random; at 2.5x it sits near 80% and still fails on the regressions it is
 * for (composer keypress was 87 ms before the speed work). By 2026-10-03 the
 * runner had the composer keypress and the cold-switch frame at 21-23 ms on
 * every attempt of every run, 100-110% of a 2.5x gate, while the same build
 * measured 8 ms and 12 ms on a desktop, so those two sit at 3x (25 ms); the
 * rest keep 2.5x. `--strict`
 * (`npm run perf:strict`) judges against the targets themselves, for runs on
 * real hardware.

/**
 * The memory contract: what the app may hold, measured once a run (counts

 * phase's result; a run fails when it is above `budget`.
 *
 * Calibrated 2026-10-10 (Grid wall, six agents streaming, 2x, SwiftShader):
 * - Overdraw: no animated layer is bigger than its clip today (0x). The beam
 *   that rotated an oversized square (fixed in #419) measured 9.6x, and it
 *   was ~70 MB of tiles per busy window on a real display.
 * - Tiles: 175-185 MB today; that beam put it at 265 MB. Chromium's tile
 *   budget is 512 MB, past which it logs "tile memory limits exceeded" and
 *   content stops drawing, so the gate holds well clear of it.
 * - Leaks: 0.2-0.5 MB of heap and no DOM nodes or listeners kept per lap.
